# GRID-Project
A simple but fun project using GRID.

What I like the most about this project is the fact that I was able to come up with a pretty different solution compared to the one used on the course by using borders instead of a black background as I'm sure many other people did.

Granted I had to reduce the dimensions on the container, but with this solution I was still able to keep the internal dimensions and using less divs/squares to achieve the same goal.
